					"description" : ["By the 1960s the check-row era was over. Planters were pulled by tractors with rubber tires, which enabled the farmers to plant more acres with less labor. Rather than a guide wire, farmers used a ''marker'' that was dragged over the soil next to the planter to guide their planting. By that time herbicides and mechanical cultivators could better control weeds in fields, so farmers could plant more seeds closer together within rows."]

Combining these tasks meant farmers could do double or triple the work with only one pass through the field.", "In the 2010s multitasking implements became essential for farmers to make a profit on their farms. The planter shown here not only applied fertilizer at the same time as planting, but it also planted seeds at extremely precise intervals and depths, and could adjust seed output based on previous years’ yields.

Some farmers continued to manually harvest their crops into the 1930s."]

(see top of next page)"]
